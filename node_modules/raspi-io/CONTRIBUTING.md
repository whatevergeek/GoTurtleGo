# Contributing to Raspi-IO

So you're interested in contributing to Raspi IO. That's awesome, go you! This document provides information on various ways that you can help out the project.

## Issues and Feature Requests

If you run into a bug, or would like to see a new feature added to Raspi-IO, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io/issues).

When submitting a bug report, please include the following information:

- Which Raspberry Pi you are using, e.g. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
- Which version of Raspbian you are using, e.g. 2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy
- Which version of Node.js or io.js you are using, e.g. Node.js 0.12.6
- A minimum reproducible test case, i.e. a short snippet that demonstrates the bug, if applicable

## Submitting Code

All code is written in ECMAScript 2015 (previously known as ECMAscript 6 or ES6). We use Babel to compile the code to ES5 and have a gulpfile to handle the translation.

To build the project, first install gulp, if you have not already, by running ```npm install -g gulp```. The run ```gulp``` from the top level directory of this repository.

The first step in the compile process lints the code to check for issues and to ensure code style conformity. The goal of code linting is to make the pull request process easier (and make sure that Bryan doesn't do something silly ðŸ˜„).

If you are unfamiliar with ES2015, take a look at [Babel's Learn EES2015 page](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/).

### Raspi IO and Raspi.js module architecture

Raspi IO uses a modular architecture, and is composed of several different NPM packages. These packages are split into two groups: Raspi IO and Raspi.js. Raspi.js provides a Raspberry Pi specific API for working with the Raspberry Pi's hardware, and Raspi IO acts as a translation layer between Johnny-Five and Raspi.js. Raspi IO is a single package, and everything else constitutes Raspi.js. This diagram shows the relationship between all of the packages:

Check out the [Raspi.js](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi) repository for more information on Raspi.js.

There are 8 package total that make up Raspi.js:

- [raspi](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi): This is the main package, analagous to the `express` package. It doesn't actually control any hardware on its own, it's only purpose is to handle initialization.
- [raspi-wiringpi](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-wiringpi): This is a support package, of sorts. It wraps up Wiring Pi into something that can be installed from NPM.
- [raspi-board](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-board): This package can be used independently of Raspi.js, and provides pin mapping services and board detection capabilities.
- [raspi-peripheral](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-peripheral): This package provides a base class that all other concrete peripherals inherit from. Any module that provides a way for interacting with hardware _must_ inherit from this class, as it handles pin contention (i.e. when someone tries to do, say, PWM and GPIO on the same pin, which isn't possible).
- [raspi-gpio](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-gpio): This peripheral package provides access to GPIO.
- [raspi-pwm](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-pwm): This peripheral package provides access to PWM.
- [raspi-i2c](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-i2c): This peripheral package provides access to I2C.
- [raspi-led](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-led): This peripheral package provides access to the on board status LED.

## Submitting Docs

If you would like to help create better documentation, then that is seriously awesome. Documentation is the heart and soul of any good open source project, and the docs for Raspi IO can always be improved.

The documentation for this project is split between the READMEs for Raspi IO and it's dependencies, and the wiki for Raspi IO. If you would like to help with any of the READMEs, create a pull request and submit it! If you would like to edit the wiki, drop into the gitter chat, or open an issue, and we'll grant you access so you can edit the wiki.

## Open Open Source

This project follows the [open open source philosophy](http://openopensource.org/). To quote the Open Open Source project:

> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

In other words, you get automatic commit access to this project when you're first non-trivial pull request is landed, and are automatically considered a core contributor. This applies to both code contributions AND documentation contributions.

## Code of Conduct

### Purpose

The core of the NodeBots community is the people in it. Our primary goal is ensure this community is as inclusive to the largest number of people, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof), or other marginalized aspect of attendees.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in contributing to Raspi-IO to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

### Raspi-IO Community Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase community citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

### Expected Behavior

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Don't make assumptions about a person's background, abilities, or intentions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert an official working group member if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech, actions, or microaggressions by any participant in our community on GitHub, related chat services, or other online spaces, in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of working group business, in person events, or at community related social events (such as a bar after an official event). Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Microaggressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial or sexual slights and insults. We consider microaggressions to be a form of harassment, and we will take appropriate action for incidences of microagressions.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, core contributors may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning. Individuals who have been banned will be prohibited from participating in GitHub discussions, issues, pull requests, any webcasts or other online or offline Raspi-IO events.

### If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a core contributor as soon as possible. Full contact information is listed in the Contact Info section of this document. All communications will be kept strictly confidential, unless otherwise required by law. No issue will be considered too inconsequential or unimportant.

Additionally, core contributors are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.

### Governing Policy and Addressing Grievances

If you receive a temporary or permanent ban, you will be [blocked on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/blocking-a-user/) by Bryan and prohibited from participating in any webcasts or other online or offline Node.js Diversity Working Group events. If you receive a temporary ban, you will be notified via the email address listed on your GitHub profile, if listed, once the ban has been lifted and you are allowed to rejoin the community.

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify us with a concise description of your grievance at the email address listed under Contact Info. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our governing policies.
